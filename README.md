Blog
========

This is my own blog. For now, it's only in Spanish, but the future may have other things in its mind. 

Setup dev environment
=======

- Have your gems up-to-date: <code># gem update</code> (Using Yosemite with SIP enabled? Use 
<code># gem update -n /usr/local/bin/</code> instead).
- Install Jekyll: <code>$ gem install jekyll</code>. (Using Yosemite with SIP enabled? Use 
<code>gem install -n /usr/local/bin/ jekyll</code> instead).
- There may be some additional components needed. I'll be adding them in the future.
- run <code>./_jekyll-serve</code> in root directory of project.
- Visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) and profit!
